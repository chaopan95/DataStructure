### Descriptioin
Let S be a set of n integral points on the x-axis. For each given interval [a, b], you are asked to count the points lying inside.
### Input
The first line contains two integers: n (size of S) and m (the number of queries). The second line enumerates all the n points in S. Each of the following m lines consists of two integers a and b and defines an query interval [a, b].
### Output
